# ml-ai
Code associated to some of the ML / AI Projects I work on during my spare time. Each folder is a ML or an AI project of its own. Below is a brief outline of each project.

### lifesciences/gene-exp-4-tumor : 
A Classification problem that studies 5 types of cancers and their underlying gene expressions.
This is a webapp with UI and backend APIs. Backend uses the most efficient model to predict the tumor given a set of gene expressions. The model Analysis is done in Jupyter notebook, serialized as a pickle file and stored in S3 for the backend to retrieve and apply.
Application is also dockerized.

### RAG : 
RAG Applications.

### bank-direct-marketing : 
A Classification problem in identifying which customers are more likely to purchase which product(s).
Analysis is done in Jupyter notebook.
![bank-direct-marketing](./bank-direct-marketing/)

### used-car-dealership : 
A regression problem used to determin the price of an used car. The challenge part of this application is the data, which is not only incomplete but also bad at many places.
![used-car-dealership](./used-car-dealership/)

### amazon-coupons : 
An early-on project in process of learning ML / AI models. Goal is to identify what type of coupons to customers have most value. 
Analysis is done in a Jupyter notebook.
